Lore


Events PID and nachinautsa in Triluna
 Holiday in the country years when 3 God Acker, Saithe and Nuture imprisoned archdemon Narino in the Charred Temple.

But something went wrong, because at the end of Trilone Appeared 4, red moon, which meant the arrival Charred on the world of GG.
 The Pantheon of Gods tried to stop, but they did not succeed, because to win would be the only one who was born in Tilonia.
 This is our HS, God, before their imprisonment in the Temple of Cleanliness, gave him strength 6 dragons.
 HE may be reborn as he is, but he is doomed to wander until he finds Narima and overcomes him. 

Charred - it's something like a Horde of Warcraft, or hordes of demons.
